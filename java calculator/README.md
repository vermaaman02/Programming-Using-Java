# Java Calculator - College Assignment

## Project Description
This is a simple Java calculator program created as a college assignment. The program demonstrates the use of:
- Scanner class for user input
- Switch-case statements for operation selection
- Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /)
- Error handling for invalid inputs and division by zero
- Loop structure for multiple calculations

## Features
- **Basic Operations**: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
- **Input Validation**: Handles invalid numbers and operators
- **Division by Zero Protection**: Prevents division by zero errors
- **Continuous Operation**: Allows multiple calculations in one session
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clear prompts and formatted output

## How to Run
1. Open terminal/command prompt
2. Navigate to the "java calculator" folder
3. Compile the program: `javac Calculator.java`
4. Run the program: `java Calculator`

## Sample Usage
```
=== JAVA CALCULATOR ===
A Simple Calculator Program
Supports: +, -, *, /
========================

Enter first number: 10
Enter operator (+, -, *, /): +
Enter second number: 5
10.00 + 5.00 = 15.00
Operation completed successfully!

Do you want to perform another calculation? (y/n): y

Enter first number: 20
Enter operator (+, -, *, /): /
Enter second number: 4
20.00 / 4.00 = 5.00
Operation completed successfully!

Do you want to perform another calculation? (y/n): n
Thank you for using Java Calculator!
Program terminated.
```

## Technical Details
- **Language**: Java
- **Input Method**: Scanner class
- **Logic Structure**: Switch-case statement
- **Error Handling**: Try-catch blocks for input validation
